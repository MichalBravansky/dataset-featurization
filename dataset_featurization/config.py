def your_prompt_template(row, features):

    Creates a prompt template for generating model responses. The template combines
    a row from the input dataframe with specified features to construct system,
    user, and assistant messages. Look below for reference.

    Args:
        row (pd.Series): Single row containing data from the input dataframe
        features (str): Feature specifications to append to the user instructions

    Returns:
        tuple: Contains three strings:
            - system_message: Defines the system's role and objective
            - user_message: User instructions with appended features

- content, structure, writing style, tone, level of detail, length, setting or locality, use of literary devices, vocabulary, messaging, complexity, audience suitability, etc.
Always suggest features that start with 'The selected string...' without mentioning the other strings.
